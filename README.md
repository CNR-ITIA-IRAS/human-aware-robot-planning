# human-aware-robot-planning
 
The package gathers all the code developed to cope with the probabilitic modelling of human operators in industrial tasks, and the generation of human-aware trajectories to improve the human robot collaboration efficienfy and safety.

# Overview

# Matlab
Run the file simulation_stack.m.

In order to load human data, indicate the path of the file "points.mat" at line 18 of the code. For instance: 'data\September2016'


In order to use random generation of trajectories: robot_random_traj=1


In order to use alraedy generated trajectories: robot_random_traj=0 and update the path at line 46. 

MinGW must be installed: https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52848-matlab-support-for-mingw-w64-c-c++-compiler
